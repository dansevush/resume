Running version can be seen at sevush.com/resume

This is a simple online resume that can be used by anyone.
I used backbone and bootstrap, and a JSON data stream that
is created using a PHP "server". You can use a static JSON file and
run it locally if needed.

Using boostrap 3.03 for mobile CSS and underscore for templates,
the only other requirements are PHP (and you can get around that
by coding the HTML tags) and any source for JSON data. I'm using
a PHP file to generate a gzipped JSON file, but you can create 
a static file and use that just as easily

resume.php
  There are some variables at the top you should edit, and you
  should update the summary JSON data to your needs. Remember
  that links should include the class 'clickable'.

resume.js
  just a few lines to take care of business, thanks to underscore
  and jQuery. Please update the JSONdataURL to reflect your
  JSON data source
   
downloadPDF
  Please modify this file to point to your resume. By default
  your browser will display the PDF, but you can add the 
  argument 'download' and it will come down as an attachment.
  
data.json.php
  This generates the JSON data. You can create a static file
  or use any source you'd like for JSON (on the same server)

This is my first github posting.
